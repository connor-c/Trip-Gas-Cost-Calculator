# Trip Gas Cost Calculator
by Connor Couture

**Technical Bits**

Uses Django, Bootstrap, and MySQL. MapQuest API used to calculate distance between two addresses. 

**Future Plans**

- Add option to just provide distance without using addresses.
- Add option to switch between metric and customary units.
- Add option to provide origin address via using user's current location.
- Add automatic language and unit localization.
- Possibly add automatic gas cost calculation using user's current location.
